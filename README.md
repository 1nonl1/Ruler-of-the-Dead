## Game Lore
It is a normal day on Earth, you are talking to your friend in a crowded city. Suddenly, you hear many people screaming. You see someone with a weapon in their hand, and they kill you. You wake up in a place unknown, not like Earth, with many creatures like Slimes, Ogres, and other creatures. This is your life now. After a while of making a base and hunting, you spot a cave in the distance, its mouth gaping like a dark invitation. Before you can enter, though, you need to gather essential supplies—perhaps a sturdy branch or some healing herbs—to prepare for the unknown challenges. With determination, you set off to explore your surroundings.

You find out that there are good and bad creatures and plants. When you defeat creatures, you feel stronger. After eliminating 32 creatures, you see words in front of your vision, **New Skill Gained: Looter, Increases loot dropped**. You also gain a sword and some armor. Before you've been eliminating docile creatures, like bunnies and slimes. But now you have killed your first low-level creature, and when eliminated, it dropped a sword and armor.
